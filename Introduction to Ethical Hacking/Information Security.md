Information Security Concepts 
==============================
Information security refers to the protection or safeguarding of information and information systems that use, store, and transmit information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Information is a critical asset that organizations must secure. If sensitive information falls into the wrong hands, then the respective organization may suffer huge losses in terms of finances, brand reputation, customers, or in other ways. To provide an understanding of how to secure such critical information resources, this module starts with an overview of information security. This section introduces the elements of information security, classification of attacks, and information warfare.

Elements of Information Security
=================================
Information security is “the state of the well-being of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of theft, tampering, or disruption of information and services is kept low or tolerable.” It relies on five major elements: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation. 
▪ Confidentiality Confidentiality is the assurance that the information is accessible only to authorized. Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improper data handling or a hacking attempt. Confidentiality controls include data classification, data encryption, and proper disposal of equipment.
▪ Integrity Integrity is the trustworthiness of data or resources in the prevention of improper and unauthorized changes—the assurance that information is sufficiently accurate for its purpose. Measures to maintain data integrity may include a checksum (a number produced by a mathematical function to verify that a given block of data is not changed) and access control (which ensures that only authorized people can update, add, or delete data).
▪ Availability Availability is the assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users. Measures to maintain data availability can include disk arrays for redundant systems and clustered machines, antivirus software to combat malware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) prevention systems.
▪ Authenticity: Authenticity refers to the characteristic of communication, documents, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted. The major role of authentication is to confirm that a user is genuine. Controls such as biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates ensure the authenticity of data, transactions, communications, and documents.
▪ Non-Repudiation: Non-repudiation is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. Individuals and organizations use digital signatures to ensure non-repudiation.

Information Security Attacks Motives, Goals, and Objectives:
============================================================
An attack is an action that is performed with the intent to breach an IT system’s security by exploiting its vulnerabilities. An attack involves an attempt to obtain, edit, remove, destroy, implant, or reveal information without authorized access. It also refers to malicious software or commands that exploit vulnerabilities to cause unanticipated behavior in legitimate software or hardware. Therefore, an attack can be conceptualized as combination of a motive, with a method to perform the attack, which exploits one or more vulnerabilities in the system.
Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method (TTP) + Vulnerability
Motives (Goals) 
Attackers generally have motives (goals), and objectives behind their information security attacks. A motive originates out of the notion that a target system stores or processes something valuable, which leads to the threat of an attack on the system. The purpose of the attack may be to disrupt the target organization’s business operations, to steal valuable information for the sake of curiosity, or even to exact revenge. Therefore, these motives or goals depend on the attacker’s state of mind, their reason for carrying out such an activity, as well as their resources and capabilities. Once the attacker determines their goal, they can employ various tools, attack techniques, and methods to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls.

▪ Disrupt business continuity 
▪ Perform information theft 
▪ Manipulating data
▪ Create fear and chaos by disrupting critical infrastructures 
▪ Bring financial loss to the target 
▪ Propagate religious or political beliefs 
▪ Achieve a state’s military objectives 
▪ Damage the reputation of the target 
▪ Take revenge 
▪ Demand ransom

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) 
===========================================
The terms “tactics, techniques, and procedures” refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups of threat actors. TTPs are helpful in analyzing threats and profiling threat actors and can further be used to strengthen the security infrastructure of an organization. The word “tactics” is defined as a strategy followed by an attacker to perform the attack from the beginning to the end. The word “techniques” is defined as the technical methods used by an attacker to achieve intermediate results during the attack . Finally, the word “procedures” is defined as a systematic approach followed by the threat actors to launch an attack. In order to understand and defend against the threat actors, it is important to understand the TTPs used by adversaries. Understanding the tactics of an attacker helps to predict and detect evolving threats in the early stages. Understanding the techniques used by attackers helps to identify vulnerabilities and implement defensive measures in advance. Lastly, analyzing the procedures used by the attackers helps to identify what the attacker is looking for within the target organization’s infrastructure.

Vulnerability
=============
A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. There are generally two main causes for vulnerable systems in a network, software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various types of attacks on organizational resources. 
Common Reasons for the Existence of Vulnerabilities 
▪ Hardware or software misconfiguration The insecure configuration of the hardware or software in a network can lead to security loopholes. For example, a misconfiguration or the use of an unencrypted protocol may lead to network intrusions, resulting in the leakage of sensitive information. While a misconfiguration of hardware may allow attackers to obtain access to the network or system, a misconfiguration of software may allow attackers to obtain access to applications and data.
▪ Insecure or poor design of network and application: An improper and insecure design of a network may make it susceptible to various threats and potential data loss. For example, if firewalls, IDS, and virtual private network (VPN) technologies are not implemented securely, they can expose the network to numerous threats
▪ Inherent technology weaknesses If the hardware or software is not capable of defending the network against certain types of attacks, the network will be vulnerable to those attacks. Certain hardware, applications, or web browsers tend to be prone to attacks such as DoS or man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, systems running old versions of web browsers are prone to distributed attacks. If systems are not updated, a small Trojan attack can force the user to scan and clean the entire storage in the machine, which often leads to data loss.
▪ End-user carelessness: End-user carelessness considerably impacts network security. Human behavior is fairly susceptible to various types of attacks and can be exploited to effect serious outcomes, including data loss and information leakage. Intruders can obtain sensitive information through various social engineering techniques. The sharing of account information or login credentials by users with potentially malicious entities can lead to the loss of data or exploitation of the information. Connecting systems to an insecure network can also lead to attacks from third parties.
▪ Intentional end-user acts: Ex-employees who continue to have access to shared drives can misuse them by revealing the company’s sensitive information. Such an act is called an intentional end-user act and can lead to heavy data and financial losses for the company.
